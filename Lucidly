Can love be understood objectively
 To understand must u  feel 
 That which cannot be done objectively
 For am i not just more than an objective 
 
 I question  life and its objective 
 Does all of this have an objective
 That said do not look at me objectively 
Objectivity

To truly understand me u must feel me 
Feel as i feel as u see what i see.

Objectively r we all more than what u see 
feelings feelings , thoughts thinking 
 objectively subjectively 
 Is everything that is and ever was as its supposed to be 
 
 Or is it just all what it is when it is until it isnt 
 All i know is it is until it isn't
 Existing between what is and what isnt 
 The more i pay attention the less vivid
